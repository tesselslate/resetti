## Debug Information

resetti allows you to dump some basic information while it is running. You can
type any of the following mnemonics into the console while resetti is running
to do so:

| Mnemonic        | Info                                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `a`, `all`      | Print everything.                                      |
| `f`, `frontend` | Print information about the frontend (user-facing UI.) |
| `g`, `gc`       | Print garbage collection and memory usage statistics.  |
| `i`, `input`    | Show the current state of inputs.                      |
