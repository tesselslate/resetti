## Setting up Minecraft

You will first need to setup your Minecraft instances. resetti has only been
tested with [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) and forks such as [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/).
It is highly recommend that you use MultiMC or a derivative, as it is much
better for managing multiple instances than the vanilla Minecraft launcher.

> *Tip:* MultiMC will allow you to duplicate instances. You can create one
> with your desired mods and settings and then copy it multiple times.

Once you have created your Minecraft instances, you will have to place a text
file in each one to let resetti know about their existence. Go to the `.minecraft`
folder of each instance and create a text file named `instance_num` within.
They should have contents like so:

```
instances
├─ 16_MULTI1
│  └─ .minecraft
│     └─ instance_num
│        └─ contents: 0
├─ 16_MULTI2
│  └─ .minecraft
│     └─ instance_num
│        └─ contents: 1
└─ 16_MULTI3
   └─ .minecraft
      └─ instance_num
         └─ contents: 2
```

> *Note:* The names of your instances do not matter here, just that they have
> the `instance_num` file.

resetti will only detect instances with the `instance_num` file. It will only
start up if the instances it detects have numbers starting from 0 and
increasing sequentially (e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...) as in the above example.

You may be able to eliminate the tedium of creating these files with a simple
shell one-liner. For example, with the fish shell:

```sh
for i in seq (1 3); echo (math $i - 1) | tee 16_MULTI$i/.minecraft/instance_num > /dev/null; end
```

> You will have to update this based on the shell you use and how you have your
> instances named.

Lastly, you will have to ensure that all of your instances have *pause on lost
focus* disabled. To do so, you can press F3+P while ingame on each instance.

## Setting up OBS

If you want to record your speedruns, then you should setup OBS. If you want to
use either the wall or set-seed resetters, then OBS is *required.*

Ensure that you have both OBS and [obs-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket) installed.
**resetti does not support `obs-websocket` 5.0; make sure that you have either
4.x or 4.x-compat installed.**

With OBS and `obs-websocket`, you can run `resetti obs` to automatically
generate a scene collection for the amount of instances you are running.

### Arguments

- `--port=PORT` - The port to connect to OBS on.
- `--pass=PASSWORD` - The password to connect to OBS with. (Optional)
- `--lockImg=PATH` - The path to the lock image. (Optional)

### Verification

The setup wizard will always ask for information about how to setup
the wall scene and verification. Supply valid information for the wall,
but you can ignore the verification prompts if you plan on using Source
Record or 2 OBS instances.

- `None` - No verification included on instance scenes.
- `Wall` - Embeds wall scene on instance scenes.
- `Inst` - Embeds individual instances on instance scenes.

### Notes

After generating a scene collection, you can make edits to it if you would like
(e.g. adding a stream overlay or creating a magnifier scene for using
Ninjabrain Bot.) Leave the existing scene items and scenes untouched, or
resetti may not work.

If you change your base/canvas resolution, you will have to delete
and recreate your scene collection(s).

## Configuration

resetti allows you to have multiple different profiles with different settings.
To begin, you can create a new profile with `resetti new PROFILE_NAME`. This
will place the default configuration at `~/.config/resetti/PROFILE_NAME.toml`.

You can edit the values as needed. You can delete sections irrelevant to your
configuration.

## Usage

Once your configuration profile has been setup, you can launch your instances
and run resetti. Launching resetti with no profile specified (e.g., just
entering `resetti` into your shell) will open a profile selection menu.
You can specify a profile (e.g. `resetti MY_PROFILE`) to immediately launch
resetti with that configuration profile.

Refer to the documentation for your reset style for more detailed information
on how to use resetti from this point onward.

> *Note:* Caps Lock and Num Lock are considered as modifiers. If enabled, they
> will prevent your keybinds from being registered. If you would like to keep
> them on, use `xmodmap` to figure out what modifiers they correspond to and
> add them to your keybinds (e.g. if Num_Lock is present under `mod2`, add
> `mod2` as a modifier to your keybind.)
