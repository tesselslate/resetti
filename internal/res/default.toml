# The keybinds section lets you specify keybindings for various actions you

# The provided keybinds simply serve as examples. You can specify one or more
# actions for each keybind. When the keybind is pressed, all of the valid
# actions will occur (e.g. specifying both a wall and ingame action for a single
# key will only perform one of them, depending on where you are.)
#
# Bind syntax:
# - Specify either a key or mouse button and 0 or more modifiers.
# - You can use the syntax `codeNUM` for a key with code NUM.
# - Most common keys, buttons, and modifiers are supported by name.
#
# Available actions:
# - ingame_focus            Focus active instance.
# - ingame_reset            Reset active instance.
# - ingame_toggle_res(n)    Toggle resolution N for the active instance.
#                           The list of alternate resolutions starts with N=0.
