# - You can ignore any keybindings here which do not apply to your reset style.
# - Alphanumerical and Fn keys (1-12) are supported.
# - If you'd like to use another key, use the syntax "code100" where 100 is the
#   keycode of the given key.
# - You can supply modifiers (Shift, Control, Alt) as well.
# - The values written are not case sensitive (e.g. `a` and `A` are equivalent,
#   specify the `Shift` modifier.)
# - There is no distinction between the left and right modifier keys.
# - For the wall keys, you may only specify modifiers. For example, if you specify
#   Shift as your wall instance reset keybind, pressing Shift-1 will reset the
#   first instance (if you have mouse support enabled, shift clicking will work
#   as well.) You can leave the keybind blank for no modifier.
# - Do not have multiple identical keybinds.
#
#   Examples:
#               `A` => The A key.
#               `a` => The A key.
#         `Shift-A` => The A key, only when Shift is held.
#  `Ctrl-Shift-F12` => The F12 key with Control and Shift held.
#         `code135` => The Menu key on my keyboard layout. Use xmodmap to find your desired key.
